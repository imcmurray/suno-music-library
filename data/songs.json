Rock in a hat!\nThat's how he translated, imagine that!\nDidn't even look at the golden plates\nJust his trusty stone and the truth awaits!\nRock in a hat! Rock in a hat!\nThe same stone from his treasure-hunting past!\nFrom con man to prophet, what a glow-up tale\nRock in a hat, it never fails!\n\nThe angel said \"Don't let anyone see!\"\nSo the plates stayed hidden, conveniently\nThe witnesses saw them with \"spiritual eyes\"\nSome later said \"Well, actually...\" surprise!\n\nBut don't you worry, don't you fret\nThe same guy who scammed you, you can trust him yet!\n\nRock in a hat! Rock in a hat!\nThat's how he translated, imagine that!\nDidn't even look at the golden plates\nJust his trusty stone and the truth awaits!\nRock in a hat! Rock in a hat!\nThe same stone from his treasure-hunting past!\nFrom con man to prophet, what a glow-up tale\nRock in a hat, it never fails!\n\nHe married thirty women, give or take\nIncluding teenagers and wives of other mates\nWhen the newspaper tried to tell the town\nHe destroyed the printing press, burned it down\nStarted a bank that totally collapsed\nRan for President (how's that for facts?)\nDied in a shootout, not quite martyred clean\nShot back himself, if you know what I mean\n\nBut millions believe it to this day\nThat golden plates just flew away\nThat a convicted fraudster became so pure\nThrough a rock in a hat, you can be sure!\n\nThe same methods he used to con and cheat\nBecame the Lord's most holy feat!\n\nRock in a hat! Rock in a hat!\nThat's how he translated, imagine that!\nDidn't even look at the golden plates\nJust his trusty stone and the truth awaits!\nRock in a hat! Rock in a hat!\nFrom glass-looking fraud to prophet stat!\nThe most American religion ever made\nRock in a hat, what a masquerade!\n\n(Rock in a hat, rock in a hat!)\n(Can you believe that? Can you believe that?)\n(Same stone, different scam!)\n(Rock in a hat!)\nAnd that's how Mormonism began!2244 / 7500",

Kinderhook Plates!\nThe prophet took the bait!\nKinderhook Plates! Kinderhook Plates!\nThe hoaxers couldn't wait!\n\n[Verse 2]\nWilliam Clayton wrote it down\nIn the prophet's history\n\"Joseph has translated part\"\nFor all the world to see\nHe said they're ancient records\nOf Ham's posterity\nBut the gentlemen who made them\nWere laughing with great glee!\n\n[Pre-Chorus - Spoken, building excitement]\nOne of them confessed it\n(Confessed it!)\n\"We made them as a joke!\"\n(As a joke!)\n\"We wanted to expose him!\"\n(Expose him!)\n\"And boy, did he just choke!\"\n\n[Chorus]\nThey're the Kinderhook Plates!\nMade in forty-three!\nJoseph said they're ancient\n(Modern forgery!)\nEtched by local blacksmiths\nWith made-up hieroglyphs\nBut Joseph started translating\nAnd that's where the story shifts!\n\nKinderhook Plates! Kinderhook Plates!\nA nineteenth-century prank!\nKinderhook Plates! Kinderhook Plates!\nThe prophet walked the plank!\n\n[Bridge - Slows down, mock serious]\nNow the church says \"Hold on there\nHe never really translated!\"\nBut William Clayton wrote it down\nThe history clearly stated\n\"I have translated a portion\"\nIn Joseph's history book\nBut now we'll say he didn't\nJust don't take a closer look!\n\n[Spoken, building back up]\nSo let me get this straight...\nSome guys made fake plates\nAs a test to see if Joseph could really translate\nAnd Joseph took one look and said\n\"Yep, these are the descendants of Ham!\"\nAnd wrote it in his journal\nAnd now the church says\n\"Well, he didn't REALLY translate them\"\nEven though he said he did?\n\nThat's CONVENIENT!\n\n[Final Chorus - Even bigger]\nThey're the Kinderhook Plates!\nThe smoking gun of fraud!\nA test that Joseph failed\nBut we'll just say he's flawed!\nModern church says \"Never mind\nWhat the history books say!\nHe examined but didn't translate!\"\n(Let's revise it all away!)\n\nKinderhook Plates! Kinderhook Plates!\nThe hoaxers did confess!\nKinderhook Plates! Kinderhook Plates!\nBut Joseph couldn't guess!\n\n[Outro - Spoken, rapid fire]\nMade by Robert Wiley\nWilbur Fugate and the crew\nBuried in a mound\nAnd dug up just for you!\nBrought them to the prophet\nTo test his gift divine\nAnd he translated forgeries\nAnd said they were genuine!\n\nOne of them confessed in eighteen-seventy-nine!\nSaid \"We made them to expose him\nAnd it worked out just fine!\"\nBut don't worry folks, the church has got\nAn explanation ready\n\"He examined them, that's all he did!\"\n(Even though the history says differently!)\n\n[Big finish with full band]\nKINDERHOOK!

    "description": "\"The Winter Solstice is the reason for the season... We're quite willi",
    "lyrics": "The Winter Solstice has been celebrated by humans for at least ten thousand years—long before any of the religions practiced today existed. Our ancestors noticed that the days grew shorter as winter approached, and they didn't know if the sun would return. So they gathered, lit fires, decorated with evergreens (the only plants that stayed alive), and celebrated when the days began to lengthen again.\nThe Romans called their celebration Saturnalia—a week of feasting, gift-giving, and candle-lighting from December 17-25. December 25 itself was \"Dies Natalis Solis Invicti\" - the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun.\nWhen Christianity spread through the Roman Empire, church leaders strategically placed Christmas on December 25 to absorb the existing pagan celebrations. As James Frazer wrote in The Golden Bough: \"The coincidences of the Christian with the heathen festivals are too close and too numerous to be accidental.\"\nThe Yule log. The decorated tree. Holly and mistletoe. Gift-giving. Candles in the darkness. Feasting with family. These are all pagan traditions that predate Christianity by centuries or millennia.\nThis song celebrates the real reason for the season: the astronomical event that our ancestors marked with wonder. The Earth tilts on her axis, the days grow short, and then - they turn. The light returns. No miracle required. Just physics. And that's worth celebrating.\nHappy Solstice.\n\n---\n\nHere we are at the turning of the year\nThe longest night is finally here\nOur ancestors gathered just like this\nAround the fire, in the dark, to reminisce\n\nThey watched the sun sink low and disappear\nAnd wondered if the light would reappear\nSo they lit their candles, built their fires bright\nAnd sang their songs through the longest night\n\nTen thousand years we've marked this day\nLong before the manger, long before the hay\n\nThe longest night! The shortest day!\nThe sun returns to light the way\nNo miracles, no magic spell\nJust Earth tilting on her axis, and all is well\nThe longest night! We gather here!\nTo celebrate the turning year\nThe oldest human holiday\nThe solstice—and the light's on its way\n\nThe Romans had Saturnalia\nFeasting, gifts, and candles bright\nThe Norse called it Yule and burned the log\nTwelve days of drinking through the night\n\nEvergreens that never die\nReminded them that spring would come\nHolly wreaths and mistletoe\nWere sacred long before the Son\n\nThe birthday of the Unconquered Sun\nWas December twenty-fifth—before that other one\n\nThe longest night! The shortest day!\nThe sun returns to light the way\nNo miracles, no magic spell\nJust Earth tilting on her axis, and all is well\nThe longest night! We gather here!\nTo celebrate the turning year\nThe oldest human holiday\nThe solstice—and the light's on its way\n\nWe don't need a virgin birth\nTo marvel at this spinning Earth\nWe don't need angels in the sky\nTo feel the wonder when the days run dry\nAnd then—they turn!\nAnd then—they turn!\nAnd the light returns!\n\nThe longest night! The shortest day!\nThe sun returns to light the way!\nNo miracles, no magic spell\nJust physics, friends, and all is well!\nThe longest night! We gather here!\nWith everyone we hold dear!\nThe real reason for the season—\nA natural holiday with real good reason!\n\nLight's on its way...\n(Light's on its way...)\nHappy Solstice Day...3297 / 7500",
