Rock in a hat!\nThat's how he translated, imagine that!\nDidn't even look at the golden plates\nJust his trusty stone and the truth awaits!\nRock in a hat! Rock in a hat!\nThe same stone from his treasure-hunting past!\nFrom con man to prophet, what a glow-up tale\nRock in a hat, it never fails!\n\nThe angel said \"Don't let anyone see!\"\nSo the plates stayed hidden, conveniently\nThe witnesses saw them with \"spiritual eyes\"\nSome later said \"Well, actually...\" surprise!\n\nBut don't you worry, don't you fret\nThe same guy who scammed you, you can trust him yet!\n\nRock in a hat! Rock in a hat!\nThat's how he translated, imagine that!\nDidn't even look at the golden plates\nJust his trusty stone and the truth awaits!\nRock in a hat! Rock in a hat!\nThe same stone from his treasure-hunting past!\nFrom con man to prophet, what a glow-up tale\nRock in a hat, it never fails!\n\nHe married thirty women, give or take\nIncluding teenagers and wives of other mates\nWhen the newspaper tried to tell the town\nHe destroyed the printing press, burned it down\nStarted a bank that totally collapsed\nRan for President (how's that for facts?)\nDied in a shootout, not quite martyred clean\nShot back himself, if you know what I mean\n\nBut millions believe it to this day\nThat golden plates just flew away\nThat a convicted fraudster became so pure\nThrough a rock in a hat, you can be sure!\n\nThe same methods he used to con and cheat\nBecame the Lord's most holy feat!\n\nRock in a hat! Rock in a hat!\nThat's how he translated, imagine that!\nDidn't even look at the golden plates\nJust his trusty stone and the truth awaits!\nRock in a hat! Rock in a hat!\nFrom glass-looking fraud to prophet stat!\nThe most American religion ever made\nRock in a hat, what a masquerade!\n\n(Rock in a hat, rock in a hat!)\n(Can you believe that? Can you believe that?)\n(Same stone, different scam!)\n(Rock in a hat!)\nAnd that's how Mormonism began!2244 / 7500",

Kinderhook Plates!\nThe prophet took the bait!\nKinderhook Plates! Kinderhook Plates!\nThe hoaxers couldn't wait!\n\n[Verse 2]\nWilliam Clayton wrote it down\nIn the prophet's history\n\"Joseph has translated part\"\nFor all the world to see\nHe said they're ancient records\nOf Ham's posterity\nBut the gentlemen who made them\nWere laughing with great glee!\n\n[Pre-Chorus - Spoken, building excitement]\nOne of them confessed it\n(Confessed it!)\n\"We made them as a joke!\"\n(As a joke!)\n\"We wanted to expose him!\"\n(Expose him!)\n\"And boy, did he just choke!\"\n\n[Chorus]\nThey're the Kinderhook Plates!\nMade in forty-three!\nJoseph said they're ancient\n(Modern forgery!)\nEtched by local blacksmiths\nWith made-up hieroglyphs\nBut Joseph started translating\nAnd that's where the story shifts!\n\nKinderhook Plates! Kinderhook Plates!\nA nineteenth-century prank!\nKinderhook Plates! Kinderhook Plates!\nThe prophet walked the plank!\n\n[Bridge - Slows down, mock serious]\nNow the church says \"Hold on there\nHe never really translated!\"\nBut William Clayton wrote it down\nThe history clearly stated\n\"I have translated a portion\"\nIn Joseph's history book\nBut now we'll say he didn't\nJust don't take a closer look!\n\n[Spoken, building back up]\nSo let me get this straight...\nSome guys made fake plates\nAs a test to see if Joseph could really translate\nAnd Joseph took one look and said\n\"Yep, these are the descendants of Ham!\"\nAnd wrote it in his journal\nAnd now the church says\n\"Well, he didn't REALLY translate them\"\nEven though he said he did?\n\nThat's CONVENIENT!\n\n[Final Chorus - Even bigger]\nThey're the Kinderhook Plates!\nThe smoking gun of fraud!\nA test that Joseph failed\nBut we'll just say he's flawed!\nModern church says \"Never mind\nWhat the history books say!\nHe examined but didn't translate!\"\n(Let's revise it all away!)\n\nKinderhook Plates! Kinderhook Plates!\nThe hoaxers did confess!\nKinderhook Plates! Kinderhook Plates!\nBut Joseph couldn't guess!\n\n[Outro - Spoken, rapid fire]\nMade by Robert Wiley\nWilbur Fugate and the crew\nBuried in a mound\nAnd dug up just for you!\nBrought them to the prophet\nTo test his gift divine\nAnd he translated forgeries\nAnd said they were genuine!\n\nOne of them confessed in eighteen-seventy-nine!\nSaid \"We made them to expose him\nAnd it worked out just fine!\"\nBut don't worry folks, the church has got\nAn explanation ready\n\"He examined them, that's all he did!\"\n(Even though the history says differently!)\n\n[Big finish with full band]\nKINDERHOOK!

    "lyrics": "[Gentle Acoustic Intro]\n[Verse 1]\nI know you lie awake at night\nScared I've lost my way\nYou wonder where you went wrong\nYou're on your knees to pray\nYou think I need a savior\nTo keep me from the dark\nBut Daddy, look at who I am\nYou built this beating heart\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou think without God I'll fall apart\nThat I'll lose what's true\nBut everything that's good in me\nI got it all from you\n[Chorus]\nIt was always you\nNot the scriptures, not the pews\nEvery good thing that I do\nI learned it all from you\nYou taught me how to love\nHow to show up, how to try\nIt was never God above\nIt was you my whole life\n[Verse 2]\nYou showed me how to tell the truth\nYou showed me I could stand\nYou held me when I was afraid\nSafe inside your hands\nYou say you were God's instrument\nJust doing what he said\nBut Daddy, it was your voice I heard\nYour words inside my head\n[Chorus]\n[Bridge]\nI know it's hard to understand\nHow I'm standing here so whole\nWithout the faith you gave your life to\nWithout it in my soul\nBut I'm not lost, I'm not broken\nI'm not wandering in the night\nI'm the proof of what you gave me\nI turned out alright\n[Final Chorus]\nIt was always you\nNot the prayers, not the pews\nEvery good thing that I do\nI learned it all from you\nYou taught me how to love\nHow to show up, how to try\nIt was never God above\nIt was you\nIt was always you\n[Outro]\nIt was you...\nIt was always you...1376 / 7500",

Layer pounding double-kick drums and thunderous bass groove locking tight into the fury.]\n[Verse 1: Sustain riff drive with rhythmic guitar overlays, subtle atmospheric synth swells for coiled aggression and depth.]\n[Chorus: Massive anthemic swells - layered power chords, dual guitar harmonies, colossal wall of sound with crashing cymbals and octave bass drops slamming like a tidal wave. Infectious melodic phrasing for earworm hooks.]\n[Bridge: Haunting clean guitar arpeggio for eerie tension contrast. Ramp to jaw-dropping dual-lead solo - lightning-fast sweeps, bends, taps trading between two guitars with emotional soaring phrasing sending chills. Back with swelling orchestral strings for epic scale.]\n[Outro: Accelerate riff to double speed for chaotic breakdown, dissolve into swirling feedback, reverb-drenched echoes, fading crowd-like percussion hits.]\n[Production: Pro-level polish - cranked high-gain guitars, crystal-clear mixes, wild dynamics from hushed tension to earth-shaking climaxes. Irresistibly catchy rhythms that burrow into the brain.]\n[Full track, 4 minutes, ultra-immersive.]1267 / 7500",
